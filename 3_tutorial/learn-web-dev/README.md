# Practice CSS 
Open HTML and CSS files for Learn Web Development (from the previous class).

Change the following things:
1. Use [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): choose one font for the ```<body>``` and one for ```<h1>``` and include them to your HTML and CSS

2. Remove ```background-color``` from ```footer``` and ```.header-menu```. Find an image you like and set body background as [```background-image```](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp) (also add ```background-size: cover;``` and see what happens). <br>

- *Optional: change color of the font.* 

3. ```<aside>``` - make links display as a column (use [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)). 

- *Optional: change color and width of border-left to better fit the background color*

4. Center your footer text (default way to do it is ```margin: 0 auto;```)
