                            <h3>London</h3>
                            <p>I visited my ex-roomate in London where we spent time at Hydepark, took pictures in front of Buckingham Palace, Big Ben and Tower Bridge. Then we devoured a lovely meal at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and had drinks at a bar next to St. Paul's Cathedral. It was short but amazing!

                        <h3>Seoul</h3>
                        <p>I was fortunate to have a 12 hrs stopover in Seoul, South Korea and was offered the free transit tour at the airport. I visited the summer palace Changdeokung. I loved the mix of old and new buildings in the city and enjoyed a really tasty lunch at a little restaurant in a tiny alley. I would like to travel there again and stay longer.</p>

                            <p>I was born in Thailand and it will always have a special place in my heart. I try to visit my family every few years. Here you can see ruins of the former capitol Ayutthaya.</p>
