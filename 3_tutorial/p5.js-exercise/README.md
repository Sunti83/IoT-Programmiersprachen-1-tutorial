# Exercise with p5.js
With this exercise we will practice use of variables, datatypes, conditionals and functions.

## Task description
You need to implement the following steps:
1. Create 2 circles with different colors(further *green circle*  and *purple circle* )
2. Position Y for both - half of the canvas height. Position X for green circle is 0, position X for purple circle is canvas width.
3. Make green circle move by 1 to the right. Make purple circle move by 1 to the left. As a result, 2 circles should meet halfway and finally reach opposite X positions.
4. Once 2 circles meet (share the same X value), start updating Y position by 1: for green circle Y position value should go up, for purple circle it should go down.
